# 2.1 Ex Ante v.s. Ex Post

事前（Ex Ante）

事后（Ex Post）

The Ex Ante and Ex Post perspectives are always defined with regard to some event that **might occur** or **has occurred**.



**如：出轨问题**

Ex Ante perspective 要求着眼于出轨发生前，即在出轨事实发生前，应对出轨的最佳方法是什么？从这一视角，你可能会更倾向于以出轨的严重后果来威胁从而阻止你伴侣出轨。

Ex Post perspective 要求着眼于出轨发生后，即在事实发生后，最佳应对方法是什么？

**如：非法移民问题**

Ex Ante, we might want to deter unauthorized immigration with the threat of punishment and deportation. 

Ex Post, we might prefer a path to citizenship.



### In the US legal system

Jury's —— Ex Post position——the quality of mercy more often resonates with the Ex Post perspective.

Judge —— Ex Ante perspective ——their job focuses them to engage in **a mixture of Ex Post and Ex Ante** decision making, <u>deciding the case before them + creating precedence</u>（will influence the decision in future disputes, at times judges will announce rules that apply only to perspective disputes）

Legislators and regulators—— Ex Ante +  Ex Post



🌰：银行抢劫案，劫匪要求柜员支付5000刀，否则杀了人质（银行客户）

==Ex Post== of the threat it seems unreasonable for the teller ~~as the banks representative to~~ refuse the demand

But the **Illinois Supreme Court**, in deciding the case in favor of the bank, took **much more** of an ==Ex Ante== perspective

> in this particular case the result may appear to be harsh and unjust, but for the protection of future business invitees, we cannot afford to extend to the criminal another weapon in his arsenal

From the Ex Ante perspective, denying liability reduces the criminal arsenal, because future criminals cannot by killing customers threaten to impose liability on banks, if the banks refuse to give the robber money. 

Denying liability, in this case, might deter future bank robberies, and thus protect future business invitees, that is future customers.



### contractual settings

often more possibility of agreement **Ex Ante**

The litigants making arguments about a past dispute are naturally in the **Ex Post** position, and unavoidably in opposition about who should bear the cost of particular risks.

But the trade association cares more about the future parties, who are in the **Ex Ante** position. 

From the **Ex Ante** position, parties are much more likely to <u>embrace legal rules that enhance the joint gains of trade.</u> 【遵循法规从而提高共同的贸易利益】

When we talk about what the **future parties want**, we're essentially taking the **Ex Ante** perspective.

==Ex Ante perspectives are particularly prized in <u>laws and economics</u>.== 

One of the worst criticisms a law economic professor can hear is to have someone point out that her <u>analysis failed to consider what is efficient from the Ex Ante perspective</u>.

【John Rawls—— radical Ex Ante perspective—— behind the veil of ignorance to analyze equity】



#### 二手车买卖case

H男想买E女的二手车，但他想要找技工检测一下这辆车。E女同意，并告诉H男，如果检测到什么问题致使你不想买这辆车，也请不要告诉我。

后来H男检测出了这辆二手车存在一些故障问题。之后两人出现如下对话。

![](https://acq7line.github.io/upload_img/secondhand%20car.png)



在这之后，如果E女在没有提及安全隐患的情况下出售了这辆车，并且购车者因此受伤了，E女是否需要承担责任？

> Yes. 你明知道可能有安全隐患却依然销售车辆，你必须得承担相应责任。

但是判断H男的责任就 harder and more interesting。H男承诺E女即时技工发现车有毛病也不告诉她。那么从法律角度上，该怎样看待这种保密协议？

观点一认为：当这种保密协议与公共政策相违背时，应以协议无效处理【non disclosure agreement 

should be unenforceable as against public policy.】。H男为了避免法律责任，应该自由披露任何负面信息。

→ But this result does not help make the world better when judged from the **Ex Ante** perspective.

如果一个保密协议是在秘密的情况下达成的共识，那么从根本上说，E女只有H男承诺不说出任何负面信息的情况下才允许他检查车况。

如果这种保密协议不具有任何约束力，那么E女就不会借出自己的车让H男检查。如果E女随意将二手车卖给其他（不知道要检查车况的）第三人，那么这个人也是会在完全不知道车辆存在安全隐患的情况下驾驶车辆。更明智的做法是既认同保密协议的约束力又明确H男的法律责任——如果他没有披露安全隐患，那么当技工发现安全隐患时，H男要么支付一小笔（约等于修理费的违约金）来修缮车辆解决安全隐患，要么H男赔付一笔巨额赔款（因为他隐瞒了重要的安全问题）。

因为受到保密协议的约束，H男很有可能选择告诉E女并付给她一笔小额违约金，尽管会有可能承担法律责任，H男仍然可能会接受这样的协议。此时，H 男得到的好处是，他会知道车辆是否处在良好状态并且可能不会面临任何法律责任。

Ex Ante analysis might suggest that enforcing the non disclosure agreement, and coupling breach damages with higher tort damages for non disclosure of safety concerns, would produce a more efficient and safe equilibrium.

【事前视角下的分析可能会认为在认同保密协议的约束力的同时，对隐瞒安全问题要求违约赔偿和更高的侵权赔偿，可以达到一个有效和安全的权衡。（但只有极少数人会以事前思维模式想那么多）】

Thus, while law and economics people tend to strongly prefer the Ex Ante analysis as a descriptive matter, our legal regime in different context displays a mixture of the Ex Ante and Ex Post analysis in its decision making.

【当法律学家和经济学家更倾向于把事前视角下的分析作为一种描述手段时，我们的法院则基于不同的情形融合事前和时候分析作出判决】

# 2.4 Default v.s. Mandatory Rule

default  rules = gap fillers

many rules are merely legal presumptions that only govern when the parties have remained silent <u>in the absence of agreements</u> to the contrary

**Default rules** can be established by common law courts or by legislatures. 

The duty of good faith is a mandatory part of every agreement, although standards of good faith can, within reason, be altered by agreement.

Every realm of law can be characterized as a mixture of default and mandatory provisions. 

⭐️ indeed for the rest of your life in the law, it's useful **whenever you learn a new rule** 

- to identify <u>whether the rule can be contracted around</u>.

- if so, how indeed a worthwhile exercise after reading each case is to <u>consider what contractual provisions would be sufficient to reverse the court's decision</u>?
- If there is **no language that could reverse the decision**, make the losing party win, no altering rules for displacing this default result, then the court is applying a mandatory rule.



Questoion: If a particular rule is not going to be immutable, how should the lawmakers set the default? 

The traditional answer is giving the parties what they would have hypothetically contracted for, if they had expressly contracted. But this hypothetical contracting rule is often devilishly difficult to apply in practice.

<u>the law</u> sometimes chooses to fill gaps with terms that <u>do not accord with the hypothetical contracting approach</u>

the best a court can do is **adopt a majoritarian approach**. And seek out which terms most parties in similar circumstances would prefer.

<font color='blue'>Contra Proferentum</font> [Latin]——resolve a contractual ambiguity by interpreting the contract against the drafting party

<font color='blue'>A penalty default rule</font>——in order to encourage the parties to reveal information to each other or to third parties, especially courts

<font color='blue'>Hadley rule</font>——limits  damages to those that are foreseeable by the breaching party

Only by revealing that you (buyer) are likely to suffer unusual losses in the case of seller breach will you be able to recover extra damages from a breaching seller



In choosing an efficient default rule, lawmakers have to consider various factors such as the preference of the majority or minority, the cost of contracting around the default, and the impact of altering rules on others. They must also establish rules for private parties to contract around the default legal treatment, taking into account the cost of altering and the possibility of errors. The goal is to minimize the cost of contracting and facilitate contractual freedom while ensuring efficiency.

- minimize the cost of party error（especially non-drafter error and <u>third party error, judicial error</u>）
- when externality concern or paternalistic concerns' protection are insufficient, lawmakers might **impose impeding altering rules**

# 2.5 Rules v.s. Standards

接上篇

example of speed limits：

A law regulating driving speed could require drivers to <u>drive less than 40 miles per hour</u>【rule】, or they might require drivers to <u>drive at a reasonable speed</u>【standard】. 

==rule==: clear, objectively **measurable** and **knowable in advance**

==standard==: a law that is fuzzier than a rule; harder to know in advance how a judge or 

agency will evaluate a particular setting

- Laws that turn on what is reasonable or prudent tend to be standards
- you might not know whether you violated the law until after a court has adjudicated the issue. 

Sometime a law might be expressed as a rule when a standard would be better suited to the situation or vice versa. Sometimes, it's better to use both a rule and a standard. 



the UCC has adopted the **standard** like reasonable price default

Instead of using a more rule like default to cover instances where contract fails to mention the contract quality. 

The <u>default quantity price</u> under the UCC is **effectively zero**.

- If your contract fails to name a **price**, contract law assumes you want **a reasonable price**. 
- If your contract fails to mention **quantity**. Contract law assumes you want to trade **zero items**.



⭐️ Training yourself to think of laws as rules or standards is a powerful tool. 

To help you both describe and critique the cases you encounter.

Think about the holding of the last case you read in any class. Did the court articulate a rule or a standard? 

What is it about the holding that tells you where the holding falls on the rule standard continuum?

# 2.8 Hohfeld's Theory of Right vs Privileges

Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld——分析法学——法律关系基本要素的框架

Hohfeld's Theory：<u>Hohfeldian权利（Hohfeldian right）</u> 和 <u>Hohfeldian权限（Hohfeldian privilege）</u> 区别

The difference between Hohfeldian rights and privileges thus turns on **whether the other party holds a privilege**. 【在于其他人是否享有权限】

- If the other party has a privilege, then I possess only a privilege. 如果其他人也享有权限 那么我仅仅拥有权限 

- If the other party has no privilege, but rather a duty, then what I have is right. 如果其他人没有权限 而是承担义务 那么我享有的就是权利

# Exit and Voice

Exit and voice：the two core ways of protecting **associational rights**. Especially **minority rights**. 

People who choose to associate with a particular group can protect themselves by leaving the group <font color='bluw'>[exit]</font>, or by complaining <font color='bluw'>[voice]</font>.

**Voice**：not only communicating with those in control to try to persuade them to change their policies, but it can also communicate to other stakeholders, and to try to persuade them to vote with you or exit. By stop associating.



## Charles Tiebout(TEE-boo), model of local government 

An example of the disciplining power of potential exit

Tiebout imagined in a world with a large number of city organizers or entrepreneurs, who each announce, for their particular city, a system of taxation and available amenities that their city will provide. 

The perspective residents of these competing cities have no right to vote or to complain. They simply vote with their feet gravitating towards cities with the appropriate mix of taxes and amenities. 

The assumption of free entry and exit in the absence of voice rights is sufficient in the Tiebout model to produce efficiency. 



📚：should the law ever require exit or voice rights? 

Should the law ever require that associations disclose to stakeholders ex ante what their exit or voice rights will be? 

What should be the default exit and voice rights for different kinds of associations?

# Acoustic Separation

A concept of Acoustic separation is developed by Meir Dan-Cohen in a Harvard Law Review article.

The acoustic separation tool is useful because it alerts you to the fact that <font color='bluw'>the law can speak simultaneously, and manage to say different things to different audiences</font>.

Acoustic separation helps distinguish between two sorts of legal rules:

- <u>Conduct rules</u> are addressed to the **general public** and are designed to **guide the public's behavior**.
- <u>decision rules</u> are **directed to officials** who are then tasked with applying the conduct rules

When these two rules diverge, the law tries to maintain an acoustic separation between what the general public hears and what the public official hears. 

e.g. criminal law 

- to the public——it's a crime to commit murder. 
- to the jury——it's a crime to commit murder if there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.



Systems with acoustic separation can help accommodate competing social values. But they raise important problems of implementation and legitimacy. 

- **Implementation problems** arise when the messages leak. 

  - e.g. when potential murderers learn that they can avoid punishment 

    if they deny prosecutors the requisite level of proof. 

- **Legitimacy problems** can arise if the public realizes that the decision rules diverge substantially from the conduct rules.



📚：Can you think of other circumstances where regulations do or should try to implement acoustic separation? 

Can you think of a circumstance where the effort to maintain different messages to different audiences has failed?
