# Normative v.s. Positive

- The **normative**（规范）, **positive**（实证） <u>dichotomy（二分法）</u> distinguishes between two different kinds of argumentation.
- A **<font color='bluw'>normative</font>** claim is **ought** talk.

**Normative** debates are about <u>what the ==content== of the law **should be**</u>.

**Positive** analysis of law seeks to <u>identify what the law **is**</u>.

Oliver Wendell Holmes（《普通法》作者）

- the life of the law has not been logic, it has been experience. 
- logic might help you derive certain <u>**positive** claims</u>,  the positive content of legal rules could be identified by investigating how they were used in practice.

### Is-ought problem from David Hume

- no <u>ought claim</u> could be correctly inferred from a set of purely factual premises. 

Hume's Law means that the fact of a mass shooting, by itself, can never be sufficient to conclude that we **should** pass new gun control laws. You can only derive <u>**should claims**</u> from premises (that include should claims). 

 just can't get from is to ought by itself. → 从 is 得出 is 的表述，从 ought 得出 ought 的表述；而不是从 is 的表述中得出 ought 的表述

### the distinction between the normative and the positive is not always cut and dried

举个 🌰：Richard Dawkins 之前发的一条推：世上所有穆斯林获得诺贝尔奖的人数比剑桥一家获得诺奖的人数还少。→Nominally **positive** claims, but can be criticized as having **normative** overtones. （表面上是实证性表述，但实际上是有规范性暗示的嫌疑）

⭐️ I have papered **over the normative motivations** of my own analysis in writing articles is by <u>converting **normative** characterizations</u> of what law should be <u>into nominally **positive claims**</u> about what people with certain normative predispositions would favor. 

在写文章时，我用来掩盖自己分析中的规范性动机（即价值判断）的一种方法是把法律应该是怎样的规范性表述改写为表面实证性表述（拥有某些规范性倾向的人会作出怎样的事）

Thus, instead of arguing that <u>the law should adopt a particular rule</u> that has efficiency-enhancing properties, I have intended to say instead that, quote, <u><font color='bluw'>efficiency-minded lawmakers would favor a particular rule</font></u>.

因此，比起说法律应该采纳某一项可以提高效率的规则，我会故意换种方式说“重视效率的立法者会倾向于采纳某一项法规”

Hume 认为，思考和阐明你的分析中可能存在的实证性暗示是一个好习惯（possible normative implications of your analysis）

历史学家：他们研究历史的某一特定层面是因为有趣

Ian more prefer to the **counter argument**：

- legal scholarship is only interesting if it might inform presentist **normative** decision making.

  <font color='bluw'>interesting = informs presentist normative question*</font>

- A presentist normative claim: a claim about how the law should be today or in the future. 

  legal scholarship is only interesting if it's consequentialist in the sense that something might turn on it.（只有当法律研究是结果主义的——与此后的结果相互影响时）

You can elicit the hidden, normative motivations of people. can find out what's behind their nominally positive claims simply by asking the author so what

⭐️ Thinking more explicitly about <u>the positive, normative dichotomy</u> can help **discipline you to avoid the <u>laziness</u> inherent in the claim（避免在表述中带上惰性）**. <u>e.g. I just think the topic is interesting.</u>

The deeper question is why that subject is interesting, which is always a normative matter.

Ian 的论点：the idea that only facts which inform normative questions are interesting



作业：What are other defensible criteria for interesting scholarship?

# Paternalism vs. Externalities: Limiting Contractual Freedom

The law can limit contractual freedom by prohibiting certain kinds of contracts.

only two normative justifications for restricting freedom of contract

- paternalism（protect parties within the contract）
  - concern that one of the nominal parties to the contract **does not have the <font color='bluw'>capacity</font>** to provide informed consent.
- externalities（parties outside the contract）
  - concern **the third parties haven't had the <font color='bluw'>opportunity</font>** to <u>consent, or withhold their consent</u>, to the transaction.

Immutable rules limit freedom of contract and this limitation is justified only if unregulated contracting would be socially deleterious <u>because parties</u>, internal or external to the contract, <u>cannot adequately protect themselves</u>.

由于合约内外的成员无法充分保护自身，而使得无管制的合约有害于社会

 if you encounter **a mandatory rule**, you should ask yourself whether the rule can be <u>justified by paternalism or by externally concerns</u>. 

→ different potential 【solutions】 to these two different concerns

- externality concerns might be alternatively solved by <font color='bluw'>giving third parties</font> a right to veto contracts that adversely affect them. Veto rights effectively make the affected parties internal to the contract.【使得受合约影响的第三方因该否决权“加入”合约】 
- paternalism concerns might be assuaged by <font color='bluw'>improving the ability of existing contractors</font> to protect themselves, rather than by extinguishing their contractual freedoms.



作业：Consider an agreement between heterosexual spouses entered into at the time of marriage in which, the woman spouse <u>promises to notify the male spouse</u> of any pregnancy and/or her intention to have an abortion, unless the woman in good faith believes that such notification would subject her to a risk of psychological or physical harm.

Should the law enforce such an agreement? Would a rule restricting women’s contractual freedom to enter into such an agreement be based on paternalism or externality concerns?

# Substance vs. Procedure

<u>Procedural rules（程序规则/法）</u> govern how, in court, the process of litigation will be carried out.

<u>Substantive rules（实体法）</u> determine what outcomes and consequences are supposed to flow from the facts found in the proceeding. 

procedural rules often can be outcome determinative.

- Procedural rules can have substantive effects
  - being the first to give an opening statement may decide some cases by causing the jury to anchor on a particular version of the events.【开场陈述可能会使陪审团对事件形成一种预判】

#### the Erie struggle

When a federal court is sitting in diversity, because the litigants come from different states, it is allowed to use federal procedural rules. 

But (under the Erie doctrine) the court cannot use federal substantive rules. the courts are supposed to apply **state substantive rules** in such settings.

#### The substance and procedure dichotomy also arises in a host of other contexts 

e.g. a contract is to be found void as unconscionable, if it is **both substantively and procedurally** unconscionable.

- A contract that is grossly one sided is substantively unconscionable, but to be procedurally unconscionable courts also demand some defect in the process of contracting（such as small print that was likely to impede the ability of the non-drafter to understand what she was signing）

  【如果合约只是单方面内容上（严重）无效，但为了找到程序上有错，法庭需要找到签署过程中的一切缺陷（比如将合同打印一部分可能会让非起草方对其所签署合同出现一些理解障碍）】

Lawyers, in their interpersonal dealings, tend to become more acutely aware of the difference between substantive and procedural failures. 



作业：

**Q1:** What conclusions does Professor Kocourek reach about <u>the distinction between procedural and substantive law</u> and <u>how courts have maintained this distinction</u>?

**Q2:** How does the Erie doctrine relate to the distinction between substantive and procedural law? (Hint: See Gacek v. American Airlines).

# The Two-by-Two Box

Whenever you learn that the law over time, or in different jurisdictions, has taken **three different approaches** to regulation, you should ask yourself whether it's possible to display these three approaches in a two by two matrix and thereby **uncover a hidden fourth approach**.

无论何时处于何种司法条件之下，当你发现在法律在实践中出现三种情形时，应该思考一下是否可将这三种情形列在一个二阶矩阵中从而推出隐藏的第四种情形

<font color='grey'># Ian's favourite law review</font>

author：Guido Calabresi and  Doug Melamed

> traditionally the nuisance pollution problem is viewed in terms of three rules. 
>
> <u>*Rule 1*</u>：Taney（甲） may not pollute unless his neighbor, his only neighbor let's assume（假定是唯一的邻居，乙）, Marshall allows it. 
>
> → That rule basically says Marshall **may enjoin** Taney's nuisance. 【甲绝对侵害了乙（乙绝对禁止）】
>
> <u>*Rule 2*</u>: Taney may pollute but must **compensate** Marshall for damages caused. 
>
> → That rule says nuisance is found, but the **remedy is limited** to damages. 【甲侵害了乙，但可以给补偿】
>
> <u>*Rule 3*</u>: Taney may **pollute at will** and can only be stopped by Marshall if **Marshall pays him off**. 
>
> → That rule says that Taney's pollution is not held to be a nuisance to Marshall.【甲没有侵害乙（如果乙不想让甲侵害，乙要给甲钱）】

The first is an entitlement to be freed from pollution and it's protected by a <font color='blue'>property rule（财产原则）</font>. 

→ Marshall is protected by a property rule **by an injunction**.【R1 Maeshall 禁止侵扰行为】

The second is also an entitlement to be free from pollution but is protected only by <font color='blue'>a liability rule（补偿原则）</font>. 

→ Marshall's initial entitlement is **protected** merrily **by damages**.【R2 仅Marshall的权利受到损害后才能请求保护】

> <u>*Rule 3*</u>, which is the <u>No Nuisance rule（非侵害法则）</u>, is instead **an entitlement to <u>Taney</u> protected by a <font color='blue'> property rule</font>**, 【此时甲的权利受法律保护】
>
> for only by buying Taney out at Tanye's price can Marshall end the pollution. 【乙只能通过购买（甲让渡的）权利，使其地方不受污染】

this Rule 3 is depicted down here, where the <u>initial entitlement</u> to pollute is given to the polluter, Taney.（Marshall can go to jail if he tries to interfere with that pollution. ）

> The very statement of these rules in the context of our framework suggests that something is missing. 
>
> Missing is a fourth rule representing an entitlement in Taney to pollute but an entitlement which is protected only by a <u>liability rule</u>. 【甲有权污染，但是该权利仅受 liability rule保护】
>

> Rule 4: Marshall may stop Taney from polluting, but if he does, he must compensate Taney.【甲不污染，但乙要给甲补偿】



**At issue in <u>Spur Industries v.s Del Webb Development Corporation</u>** 

> a demand by the developer of a rapidly expanding retirement community. That a **pre-existing cattle feed lot be shut down**（请求） because it generated odors and flies that annoyed the community residents. 

Trying to balance several competing considerations, the seriousness of the harm,

> the fact that the developer, by building houses in close proximity to the feedlot, had come to the nuisance and the innocence of the community residents. 【实际上是开发公司将房屋建造在养殖场附近的行为导致了这个nuisance】

> the court granted an injunction against the continued operation of the feedlot. 
>
> But required the developer to indemnify the feedlot operator, “for a reasonable amount of the cost of moving or shutting down”
>
> 【法庭发布了禁止养殖场继续运营的禁令，但是同时命令开发商赔偿养殖场运营一笔“搬迁或停业成本的合理金额”】

Such a composite ruling,  is an example of Calebresi and Melamed's **rule four**. 【判决先于文章】

But its ruling provides strong support for the author's contention that **a purchase injunction** might make it possible to reconcile seemingly incompatible distributional and efficiency goals.

***********

The common law of contract has three traditional ways to calculate monetary damages. 

No.1：<u>expectation damages（预期损失赔偿）</u> have the objective quote to **put the injured party** in as good position as he would have been in if **the contract had been performed**. 【使损失方回到合同履行后的地位】

No.2：<u>reliance damages（依赖损失赔偿）</u> have the objective to **put the injured party** back in the position he would have been in if **the contract had not been made**.

【使损失方回到订立合同**前**他所处的地位】

No.3:  <u>restitution damages（归还损失赔偿）</u> have the objective to **put the party in breach** back in the position, he would have been in if the contract **had not been made**. 

【使<font color='bluw'>违约方</font>回到订立合同**前**他所处的地位 】

问题：那么rule 4是什么？

Put the **party in breach** in the same position he would be in were he to **have performed** on the contract
