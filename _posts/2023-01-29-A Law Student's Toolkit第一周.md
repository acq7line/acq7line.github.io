# intriduction

为支撑自己的主张，律师和法学学者在制造论点时有固定套路，本课程能将使你更容易地掌握这些套路。

本课程中的概念很多是二分的区别对立，这将有助于更好地对法律规则进行归类，帮助了解法律作出怎样的监管选择。

本课程结合了法律与经济学视角（a slight law and economics bias）—— economics is the science of means.

Bonus——对法学院新生建议：

1. 找一个律师朋友向他学习如何引用及查找案例（how to cite and find cases） & 如何引用法律法规（how to cite and find statutes and regulation）

   在正式入学之前，知道如何运用法律图书馆

2. 记住在位最高院法官的名字（他们的政治光谱，以及在判决时谁的作用更关键 ）

# Basic Legal Terms

**Judgment:** The final disposition of a lawsuit. 

**Judgment n.o.v.:** Literally, a judgment non obstante verdicto, which translates as judgment notwithstanding the verdict; it is a judge's decision to decide a case contrary to the verdict of the jury. 

**Summary Judgment:** Disposition of a claim without trial when there is no dispute as to material fact, or if only a question of law is involved. 

**Declaratory Judgment:**  A judgment that, without the need for enforcement, declares the rights of the parties or an interpretation of the law. A binding adjudication of the rights and status of litigants even though no actual, consequential relief is awarded. A party asks for a declaratory judgment if it feels the law is unclear, wants to be sure it is acting legally before acting, or wants to inform everyone that a certain action is legal or illegal. Such a judgment is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties as to the matters declared. For example, a court may be asked to issue a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of a statute. Compare with injunctions. 

**Directed Verdict:** In a case in which the party with the burden of proof has failed to present a prima facie case for jury consideration, the trial judge may order the entry of a verdict without allowing the jury to consider it, because, as a matter of law, there can be only one such verdict. A directed verdict finding of not guilty may be appealed to a higher court, whereas a jury finding of not guilty cannot.

**Decree:** The judgment of a court of equity or chancery, answering for most purposes to the judgment of a court of law. A decree in equity is a sentence or order of the court, pronounced on hearing and understanding all issues, and determining the rights of all the parties to the suit, according to the equity and good conscience. With the procedural merger of law and equity under the Rules of Civil Procedure, <u>the term "judgment" has generally replaced "decree."</u>

**Dicta:** An observation or remark made by a judge in pronouncing an opinion upon a cause, concerning some rule, principle, or application of law, but not necessarily involved in the case or essential to its holding; any statement of the law enunciated by the court merely by way of illustration, argument, analogy, or suggestion, lacking the force of adjudication. Dicta does not have the force of law, as it is incidental to the main issue before the court. 

**Overrule:** To make void. A judicial decision is said to be overruled when a later decision, rendered by the same court or by a superior court in the same system, expresses a judgment upon the same question of law directly opposite to the earlier opinion, thereby depriving it of all authority as a precedent. 

**Ex Contractu:** A common-law action arising out of contract or a cause of action arising from a breach of promise. 【合同法】

**Ex Delicto:** A common-law action arising out of tort or a cause of action arising from breach of duty growing out of contract. 【侵权法】

**Ex Ante:** Before the fact or event in question has occurred.

**Ex Post:** After the fact or event in question has occurred.

**Finding:** Formal conclusion by a judge or regulatory agency on issues of fact; also, a conclusion by a jury regarding a fact. Usually findings of fact cannot be appealed once the lower court has made its determination. 

**Holding:** The legal principle to be drawn from the opinion of the court; the answer to the question posed before the court. 

**Remand:** To send a dispute back to the lower court where it was originally heard. Usually it is an appellate court that remands a case for proceedings in the trial court consistent with the appellate court's ruling. 

**Reverse:** To make void a judgment of a lower court by an appellate court, or to change to a contrary or former condition. 

**Stare Decisis:** Akin to precedent, the doctrine that courts will follow principles of law laid down in previous cases.

# The structure of the courts



## the federal level

The trial courts are called **United States District Courts**

- e.g. Massachusetts has only one federal judicial district, which covers the whole state and is called the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

- California has four federal judicial districts, each of which covers a discrete geographic region of the state： U.S. District Court for <u>the Northern District of California, the Central District of California, the Southern District of California and the Eastern District of California</u>.

## Federal intermediate appellate courts 

Known as **United States Courts of Appeals**. There are 13 federal Courts of Appeals, each of which covers a particular geographical area known as a "circuit." 

- When a party to a lawsuit in a U.S. District Court wants to appeal that court's decision, the appeal normally goes to the U.S. Court of Appeals covering that district.

- Except for the D.C. Circuit, each Court of Appeals circuit encompasses several states.
