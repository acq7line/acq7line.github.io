# Ex Ante v.s. Ex Post

事前（Ex Ante）

事后（Ex Post）

The Ex Ante and Ex Post perspectives are always defined with regard to some 

event that **might occur** or **has occurred**.



**如：出轨问题**

Ex Ante perspective 要求着眼于出轨发生前，即在出轨事实发生前，应对出轨的最佳方法是什么？从这一视角，你可能会更倾向于以出轨的严重后果来威胁从而阻止你伴侣出轨。

Ex Post perspective 要求着眼于出轨发生后，即在事实发生后，最佳应对方法是什么？

**如：非法移民问题**

Ex Ante, we might want to deter unauthorized immigration with the threat of punishment and deportation. 

Ex Post, we might prefer a path to citizenship.



### In the US legal system

Jury's —— Ex Post position——the quality of mercy more often resonates with the Ex Post perspective.

Judge —— Ex Ante perspective ——their job focuses them to engage in **a mixture of Ex Post and Ex Ante** decision making, <u>deciding the case before them + creating precedence</u>（will influence the decision in future disputes, at times judges will announce rules that apply only to perspective disputes）

Legislators and regulators—— Ex Ante +  Ex Post



🌰：银行抢劫案，劫匪要求柜员支付5000刀，否则杀了人质（银行客户）

==Ex Post== of the threat it seems unreasonable for the teller ~~as the banks representative to~~ refuse the demand

But the **Illinois Supreme Court**, in deciding the case in favor of the bank, took **much more** of an ==Ex Ante== perspective

> in this particular case the result may appear to be harsh and unjust, but for the protection of future business invitees, we cannot afford to extend to the criminal another weapon in his arsenal

From the Ex Ante perspective, denying liability reduces the criminal arsenal, because future criminals cannot by killing customers threaten to impose liability on banks, if the banks refuse to give the robber money. 

Denying liability, in this case, might deter future bank robberies, and thus protect future business invitees, that is future customers.



### contractual settings

often more possibility of agreement **Ex Ante**

The litigants making arguments about a past dispute are naturally in the **Ex Post** position, and unavoidably in opposition about who should bear the cost of particular risks.

But the trade association cares more about the future parties, who are in the **Ex Ante** position. 

From the **Ex Ante** position, parties are much more likely to <u>embrace legal rules that enhance the joint gains of trade.</u> 【遵循法规从而提高共同的贸易利益】

When we talk about what the **future parties want**, we're essentially taking the **Ex Ante** perspective.

==Ex Ante perspectives are particularly prized in <u>laws and economics</u>.== 

One of the worst criticisms a law economic professor can hear is to have someone point out that her <u>analysis failed to consider what is efficient from the Ex Ante perspective</u>.

【John Rawls—— radical Ex Ante perspective—— behind the veil of ignorance to analyze equity】



#### 二手车买卖case

H男想买E女的二手车，但他想要找技工检测一下这辆车。E女同意，并告诉H男，如果检测到什么问题致使你不想买这辆车，也请不要告诉我。

后来H男检测出了这辆二手车存在一些故障问题。之后两人出现如下对话。在这之后，如果E女在没有提及安全隐患的情况下出售了这辆车，并且购车者因此受伤了，E女是否需要承担责任？

> Yes. 你明知道可能有安全隐患却依然销售车辆，你必须得承担相应责任。

但是判断H男的责任就 harder and more interesting。H男承诺E女即时技工发现车有毛病也不告诉她。
