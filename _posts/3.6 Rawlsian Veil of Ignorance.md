# 3.6 Rawlsian Veil of Ignorance

**John Rawls —— Veil of Ignorance**

how a person would want to organize society if the person were placed in what Rawls called, the original position.



Rawls argued that behind the veil of ignorance, people would agree to a much more egalitarian distribution of wealth. 

In particular, Rawls claimed that those in the original position would all prefer a Maximin strategy, which would maximize the prospects of the least well-off person in society.
